  # applications can start streaming market data with a single method call.

    # Establishes a WebSocket connection and yields decoded ticks.

    #     puts tick.inspect
    #   end

    # @param mode [Symbol] Desired feed mode (:ticker, :quote, :full).
    # @yield [tick]
    # @yieldparam tick [Hash] A decoded tick emitted by the streaming API.
    # @return [DhanHQ::WS::Client] The underlying WebSocket client instance.
